Lab 3b - Lambda


To complete the task, I started by creating a serverless application using AWS Lambda. I went to the Lambda service in the AWS Management Console and clicked on "Create function" to set up a new Lambda function from scratch.

 Click on create the function and select the language of your application.

I named the function and chose Python as the runtime. Then, I wrote the function code to handle addition and subtraction operations on two input numbers. I tested the function in the Lambda console by providing sample input data and verifying that it produced the correct results.

After ensuring the function worked as expected, I deployed it by clicking the "Deploy" button in the Lambda console. To invoke the Lambda function, I used AWS SDKs to programmatically trigger it or integrated it with other AWS services like API Gateway for HTTP triggers. For monitoring and debugging, I utilized AWS CloudWatch to keep track of logs and metrics to optimize performance.

These are my results and outputs of this task as shown in the figure.
This hands-on experience with serverless computing concepts and AWS Lambda provided valuable insight into building scalable and efficient applications on the cloud platform.
